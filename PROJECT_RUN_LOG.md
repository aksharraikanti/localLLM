# Project Run Log

This log provides a chronological record of completed tasks and plans. At the end of each task or action, append a concise summary.

---

*Initial log entry created.*

## Action 1: Project Log Initialization

- Created PROJECT_RUN_LOG.md to track progress.
- Removed AGENTS.md and all agent-specific instructions.
- Confirmed .gitignore ignores AGENTS.md.

## Detailed Plan for Action 2 (Next Steps – Tomorrow)

**2.1 Branching & Environment Setup**
- Create a new feature branch `feature/initial-setup`.
- Ensure `main` branch is up to date (`git fetch && git checkout main && git pull`).

**2.2 Environment Template & Dependencies**
- Add `.env.template` with placeholder variables for API keys.
- Update `README.md` with instructions to copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
- Define initial dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

**2.3 Pre-commit Configuration**
- Add or validate `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks for `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`.
- Run `pre-commit install` and test on existing files.

**2.4 CI Workflow Skeleton**
- Scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Python environment
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting
  - Run tests
- Add a simple placeholder test under `tests/` to validate pytest integration.

**2.5 README Updates**
- Draft “Getting Started” section in `README.md`.
- Add badges placeholders for CI and Python version.

At end of tomorrow’s work, append “Action 2” summary here with outcomes and any blockers.

## Action 2: Initial Setup

- Created feature branch `feature/initial-setup`.
- Added `.env.template` and documented placeholder variables.
- Added `requirements.txt` with initial runtime dependencies.
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Black, isort, and Flake8 hooks.
- Installed pre-commit hooks and verified setup on changed files.
- Scaffolded CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for linting and testing.
- Added placeholder test `tests/test_placeholder.py` to validate pytest.
- Updated `README.md` with Getting Started instructions and CI/Python badges.
- Ran pytest successfully and verified pre-commit hooks on modified files.

## Action 3: Data Collection & Curation (Day 3)

**3.1 Define Domain & Scope**
- Created `data/DOMAIN.md` with target topics and tags for Kubernetes support.

**3.2 Fetch Script Scaffold**
- Added `scripts/fetch_stackexchange.py` with CLI args, environment-variable checks, and placeholder `fetch_questions` implementation.

**3.3 Unit Test for Fetch Script**
- Added `tests/test_fetch_stackexchange.py` asserting `fetch_questions` raises `NotImplementedError`.

**3.4 Update Run Log**
- Appended this Action 3 summary and day-of-work details.

At end of day, implement placeholder test and proceed to flesh out fetch logic under Action 4.

## Action 4: Implement Fetch Logic (Day 4)

**4.1 fetch_questions Implementation**
- Added real API calls to Stack Exchange `/questions` endpoint with pagination, rate-limit sleep, and body filter.

**4.2 Unit Tests for Pagination**
- Extended `tests/test_fetch_stackexchange.py` with `test_fetch_questions_pagination` mocking `requests.get` to verify loop logic.

At end of day, run integration fetch on a small tag set and draft scraping scripts under Action 5.

## Action 5: Initial Data Fetch & FAQ Scraper (Day 5)

**5.1 Integration Fetch Smoke Test**
- Execute `scripts/fetch_stackexchange.py` on a small tag set to verify API connectivity and write raw JSON under `data/raw/stackexchange.json`.

**5.2 FAQ Scraper Tests & Script Validation**
- Added `tests/test_scrape_faqs.py` to validate `scrape_faq_page` behavior with mocked HTML.

**5.3 Integration Fetch Test**
- Added `tests/test_integration_fetch.py` (skipped if no API key) to verify live API fetch.

**5.4 Directory Setup**
- Created `data/raw/.gitkeep` to track the raw data folder.

At end of tomorrow’s work, review fetched data, run scrapers on sample FAQ URLs, and proceed to Action 6 (data cleaning).

## Action 6: Data Cleaning Pipeline (Day 6)

**6.1 clean_data Implementation**
- Completed `scripts/clean_data.py` with Unicode normalization (NFKC), HTML stripping via Bleach, whitespace collapse, length filtering, and deduplication logic.

**6.2 Unit Tests for Cleaning**
- Added `tests/test_clean_data.py` covering `clean_text`, `extract_qa`, and `clean_dataset` end-to-end on sample data.

**6.3 Dependency Update**
- Added `bleach` to `requirements.txt` for HTML tag removal.

At end of day, run cleaning on a sample raw dump and generate `data/clean/stackexchange_clean.jsonl`, then plan preprocessing merges under Action 7.
