# Project Run Log

This log provides a chronological record of completed tasks and plans. At the end of each task or action, append a concise summary.

---

*Initial log entry created.*

## Action 1: Project Log Initialization

- Created PROJECT_RUN_LOG.md to track progress.
- Removed AGENTS.md and all agent-specific instructions.
- Confirmed .gitignore ignores AGENTS.md.

## Detailed Plan for Action 2 (Next Steps – Tomorrow)

**2.1 Branching & Environment Setup**
- Create a new feature branch `feature/initial-setup`.
- Ensure `main` branch is up to date (`git fetch && git checkout main && git pull`).

**2.2 Environment Template & Dependencies**
- Add `.env.template` with placeholder variables for API keys.
- Update `README.md` with instructions to copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
- Define initial dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

**2.3 Pre-commit Configuration**
- Add or validate `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with hooks for `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`.
- Run `pre-commit install` and test on existing files.

**2.4 CI Workflow Skeleton**
- Scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Python environment
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting
  - Run tests
- Add a simple placeholder test under `tests/` to validate pytest integration.

**2.5 README Updates**
- Draft “Getting Started” section in `README.md`.
- Add badges placeholders for CI and Python version.

At end of tomorrow’s work, append “Action 2” summary here with outcomes and any blockers.

## Action 2: Initial Setup

- Created feature branch `feature/initial-setup`.
- Added `.env.template` and documented placeholder variables.
- Added `requirements.txt` with initial runtime dependencies.
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Black, isort, and Flake8 hooks.
- Installed pre-commit hooks and verified setup on changed files.
- Scaffolded CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for linting and testing.
- Added placeholder test `tests/test_placeholder.py` to validate pytest.
- Updated `README.md` with Getting Started instructions and CI/Python badges.
- Ran pytest successfully and verified pre-commit hooks on modified files.
