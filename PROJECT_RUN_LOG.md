**2.4 CI Workflow Skeleton**
- Scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Python environment
  - Install dependencies
  - Run linting

## Action 5: Initial Data Fetch & FAQ Scraper (Day 5)

**5.1 Integration Fetch Smoke Test**

**5.2 FAQ Scraper Tests & Script Validation**
- Added `tests/test_scrape_faqs.py` to validate `scrape_faq_page` behavior with mocked HTML.

**5.3 Integration Fetch Test**
- Added `tests/test_integration_fetch.py` (skipped if no API key) to verify live API fetch.

**5.4 Directory Setup**
- Created `data/raw/.gitkeep` to track the raw data folder.

At end of tomorrow’s work, review fetched data, run scrapers on sample FAQ URLs, and proceed to Action 6 (data cleaning).

## Action 6: Data Cleaning Pipeline (Day 6)

**6.1 clean_data Implementation**
- Completed `scripts/clean_data.py` with Unicode normalization (NFKC), HTML stripping via Bleach, whitespace collapse, length filtering, and deduplication logic.

**6.2 Unit Tests for Cleaning**
- Added `tests/test_clean_data.py` covering `clean_text`, `extract_qa`, and `clean_dataset` end-to-end on sample data.

**6.3 Dependency Update**
- Added `bleach` to `requirements.txt` for HTML tag removal.

At end of day, run cleaning on a sample raw dump and generate `data/clean/stackexchange_clean.jsonl`, then plan preprocessing merges under Action 7.

## Action 7: Data Consolidation & Statistics (Day 7)

**7.1 Directory Setup**
- Added `.gitkeep` in `data/clean/` and `data/processed/` to track directories.

**7.2 Merge Cleaned Data**
- Created `scripts/merge_cleaned.py` to combine all `*.jsonl` under `data/clean/` into `data/clean/combined.jsonl`.

**7.3 Compute Statistics**
- Added `scripts/stats.py` to compute average question/answer tokens and vocabulary size; outputs `data/processed/stats.md`.

At end of tomorrow’s work, merge cleaned files, run stats, validate outputs, and proceed to Action 8 (model fine-tuning scaffolding).

## Action 8: Model Fine-Tuning Scaffolding (Day 8)

**8.1 Dataset Preparation Script**
- Added `scripts/prepare_dataset.py` to load combined JSONL, convert to a Hugging Face dataset, and tokenize examples.

**8.2 Training Script**
- Added `scripts/train_model.py` with CLI entrypoint using `transformers.Trainer` and `TrainingArguments` to fine-tune on the tokenized dataset.

**8.3 Configuration Template**
- Added `configs/train_config.yaml` to provide a template for adjustable training parameters (batch size, epochs, learning rate, etc.).

**8.4 Tests for Scaffolding**
- Added `tests/test_prepare_dataset.py` and `tests/test_train_model.py` mocking HF components to validate dataset preparation and training logic.

**8.5 Requirements Update**
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `tokenizers`, `pyyaml`, and `tqdm` for model fine-tuning support.

At end of day, validate dataset preparation on a small sample, dry-run the training script, and plan hyperparameter tuning under Action 9.

## Action 9: Hyperparameter Tuning Pipeline (Day 9)

**9.1 Search Script**
- Added `scripts/hyperparameter_search.py` to run Optuna-based HPO using `Trainer.hyperparameter_search`.

**9.2 Search Space Config**

**9.3 Requirements Update**
- Added `optuna` to `requirements.txt` for optimization backend.

**9.4 README & Documentation**
- Updated `README.md` with instructions for running HPO and pointers to search-space config.

At end of tomorrow’s work, execute a multi-trial search, evaluate best run on validation set, and prepare evaluation metrics report under Action 10.

## Action 10: Evaluation Metrics & Reporting (Day 10)

**10.1 Evaluation Script**
- Add `scripts/evaluate_model.py` to generate predictions on cleaned data and compute ROUGE metrics.

**10.2 Dependency Update**
- Add `evaluate` and `rouge-score` to `requirements.txt` for evaluation backend.

**10.3 README Update**
- Update `README.md` to include instructions for running the evaluation script.

**10.4 Report Generation**
- Evaluation script writes a markdown report `data/processed/eval_report.md` with computed metrics.

At end of day, review evaluation metrics, compare models, and proceed to Action 11 (inference API scaffolding).

## Action 9: Hyperparameter Tuning Pipeline (Day 9)

- Added `scripts/hyperparameter_search.py` to run Optuna-based HPO using Trainer.hyperparameter_search.

- Added `optuna` to `requirements.txt` for the optimization backend.
- Updated `README.md` with instructions for running HPO and pointers to the search-space config.
- Verified that `hyperparameter_search.py` runs a minimal trial without errors.
